Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
  return [
    Text(product.imageUrl, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 64))
      .container(height: 120, color: context.colorScheme.surfaceContainerHighest)
      .hero('product_${product.id}'),
    
    [
      Text(product.name, style: context.textTheme.titleMedium),
      Text(product.description),
      8.heightBox,
      [
        Text(product.price.toCurrency).expanded,
